Design



animal population simulator

user inputs number of predators, prey and time frame, then the program simulates the fluctions in the population over time 
and then outputs the changes in the population and the final population.


Classes:

animal
eat
breed
age


predator
hunt (polymorphism of eat)


prey




each animal  will have a set behaviour ie how often they eat and how often the reproduce etc.


main function

call function that creates the animals using user input to determine number of predators and number of prey and time frame.



stretch goal:
Currently the animals will have static behaviour. if we have time we will hopefully be able to allow the user the change the animals behavior
eg rabbits that reproduce 2 times a day etc.
